Background Context:
simple UNIX command interpreter.


We make a programme shell that let us input commands shell i give us the same output as terminal linux shell.

A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like
operating systems. The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and is used by
the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.
